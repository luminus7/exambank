---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This script requires setuptools version 0.6c11 to run (even to display
help).  I will attempt to download it for you (from
http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/s/setuptools/), but
you may need to enable firewall access for this script first.
I will start the download in 15 seconds.

(Note: if this machine does not have network access, please obtain the file

   http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg

and place it in this directory before rerunning this script.)
